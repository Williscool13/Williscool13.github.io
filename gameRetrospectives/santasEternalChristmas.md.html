Santa's Eternal Christmas is a solo game jam game made for the Winter MelonJam 2023 with the jam theme of **Charm**.
It is a branch of my third person controller project (similar to [STRF](strf.md.html)), and has the player play as Santa. 
Santa is out for festive blood and sets out to eradicate all the other festivals from history.
The game itself plays as a third person platformer/shooter, with a little dialogue from a narrator at the end of the game. 

# The 3 Cs
## Character
The player character in this game is Santa Claus. Christmas had just passed and it was time to pass the holiday torch on to the next holiday.
But Santa decided: Why can't it be Christmas season all year long? 
So in the celebration village, the village where all the holiday spirits reside, Santa sets out to make all the spirits feel permanent Christmas cheer.

## Controls
The game is, for the most part, controlled like a 3d platformer: WASD, Jumping, Picking up/Throwing. 
The player would have to take advantage of the terrain and magical wind gusts to traverse the large map.
The player spreads cheer to other festival spirits by picking up magical presents and throwing it at the other spirits' faces.
Doing so converts them into either one of santa's elves or a mall santa.
Alternatively, the player can use a candy cane gun and shoot magical presents instead of throwing them.


## Camera
The camera remains in a third person perspective for the entirety of the gameplay portion. 
The camera system utilizes cinemachine's third person system. 
The collider feature is enabled, causing the camera to collide with walls to ensure that the player character is always in view.
Otherwise, the camera typically looks at a hidden target which is 100 units in front of the player.

# Level Design
The entire game is contained within 1 large map, with 9 festival charms scattered around the area.
There were many aspects to consider when designing the level. Among them are: 

 - [Gameplay](santasEternalChristmas.md.html#gameplay)
 - [Environment](santasEternalChristmas.md.html#environment)
 - [Atmosphere](santasEternalChristmas.md.html#atmosphere)

## Gameplay

The player begins the game in an enclosed room. Leaving this room reveals the primary objective for the player: The World.
This large wooden door is sealed shut. The player is also immediately exposed to a large number of charms scattered around their screen (in addition to the HUD).

Further investigation from the player will reveal that the 9 charms are the key to leaving this area.
Early exposure to a myriad of avenues of investigation assists in minimizing confusion. 
Defining a clear goal and a set of potential paths to achieve that goal assists in engaging the player.

The 9 festival charms are hidden in various ways, frequently requiring some puzzle-solving from the player.

For example, the halloween charm is trapped in a cage. 
It requires the player to solve a matching puzzle with the solution revealed from environmental clues around the area.
For this puzzle, it was important that the player understand the puzzle, rather than randomly shuffling the pieces until they find the correct sequence.

Another example is the Christmas charm.
This charm is located in Santa's sleigh, at the center of the map. 
This puzzle entices exploration, incentivizing the player to seek the charm through careful observation of the layout of the level.

## Environment

(###) **Terrain Sculpting**

The map itself is sculpted using a [terrain tool](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/landscape-builder-55463). The tool is a third party package that builds upon Unity's terrain system.
The layout of the map is a secluded valley, with tall mountains surrounding the lower playfield.
The game is set during Christmas -- in the middle of winter. 
Thus the map is snowy; filled with a winter atmosphere and christmas ornaments.

Trees could be easily scattered around the map, placed in groups and clustered to avoid overpopulating the map.
The placement of the trees were dictated by the elevation of the landscape.
With more time, the trees would have been optimized to be impostors/billboards at significant distances. In this project, they were simply 3d meshes (gameobject instances).

The terrain builder simplified the process of sculpting the landscape, allowing me to focus my time on other aspects of the game.


(###) **Verticality**

An aspect of level design that I hadn't explored very much in my previous games is verticality.
In this map, several charms are located far above the ground, encouraging the player to look at their surroundings to figure out the solution to puzzles.

There are several instances of "Wind Gusts". 
These winds shoot the player in a pre-determined direction and are primarily used to rapidly gain verticality.
This design directly enabled me to create several charm puzzles. It involves the player chaining these wind gusts to reach a charm suspended high above.

## Atmosphere

The atmosphere of the game was designed to be solemn and somber. The holiday cheer is infectious and spells the doom of the other spirits.

To appropriately convey this emotion, a sountrack from from [PlusMusic](https://amp.plusmusic.ai) was used. 
Though their API was difficult to work with at times, such as poor response times, significantly large file sizes (FLAC), and complex code.

(###) **Particle Effects**

A fair amount of work was done on the particle effects in this project. 

![Snow, Charm Items, Wing Gusts](sec/snow.png)

Using a fairly basic snow particle system, consistent snowfall helped to further immerse the player into the winter atmosphere.
This had the unintended effect of hiding the stars in the skybox, resulting in the sky appearing emptier than it would otherwise.

Using a particle system pack from the asset store, I had broken down several independent particle systems. They were manipulated to create effects appropriate for the setting.

The effects are slightly cartoonish and colorful as this would blend better with the assets I had chosen to use.
All art in this game was not created by me. A full credit list can be found on the itch page. Notably, the models are mostly from [Scynty](https://syntystore.com/).


(###) **Shader Effects**

A shading technique that has long interested me is the toon shader. 
The crisp colored outlines to highlight the silhouette of objects has always stood out as remarkably efficient.
This toon outline technique can naturally be used to emphasize the player's selection.

This is only used once in this game: To highlight the object that the player is hovering over. This could only be seen on (unused) presents and the candy cane gun.
Although seemingly minor, the effect subtly helps inform players of their interaction state in the game.

# Programming

As mentioned earlier, this game builds upon my third person shooter base project I had been developing over a few months.
The base project has several seemingly minor features that are crucial for an immersive 3-D TPS game.

(##) Footsteps

The base project has a footstep system that uses scriptable object groups to easily swap between different sounds.
Each footstep collection contains lists of footstep sounds that are randomly selected when appropriately triggered.

The system triggers walking and running through animation events to better align with the visual state of the player.
When triggered, the game samples the ground directly beneath the player for its surface material. This allows the footstep system to have
different responses on different surfaces. This footstep changing system works with both mesh-based and terrain-based surface.

The choice to sample the surface directly beneath the player is not always the appropriate one. The player's collider is a capsule. 
This can result in a "hanging" effect when the player stands over an edge. When hanging, there may not always be a surface directly below the player. 
This can be remedied by instead sampling the contacted surface if the player is not firmly on a surface.

(###) **Footstep Collection**


```
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "FootstepCollection"
  , menuName = "ScriptableObjects/DataContainers/FootstepCollection")]
public class FootstepCollection : ScriptableObject
{
    public List<AudioClip> footstepWalkSounds = new();
    public List<AudioClip> footstepRunSounds = new();
    public List<AudioClip> footstepJumpSounds = new();
    public List<AudioClip> footstepLandSounds = new();
}
```

(###) **Surface Sampling Code**

```
public void CheckLayers() {
	RaycastHit hit;
	if (
	  Physics.Raycast(
	    transform.position, 
		-footstepManager.transform.up, 
		out hit, terrainCheckRange
	  )){

		// Mesh Check
		if (hit.transform.GetComponent<SurfaceType>() != null) {
			FootstepCollection fc = hit.transform.GetComponent<SurfaceType>().FootstepCollection;
			currentLayerName = fc.name;
			footstepManager.SetFootstepCollection(fc);
			Debug.Log("Found Mesh");
			return;
		}

		// Terrain Check
		if (hit.transform.GetComponent<Terrain>() != null) {
			Terrain t = hit.transform.GetComponent<Terrain>();

			string layerName = terrainChecker.GetLayerName(transform.position, t);
			int layerId = terrainChecker.GetLayerId(transform.position, t);
			if (currentLayerName != layerName) {
				currentLayerName = layerName;
				foreach (FootstepCollection fc in footstepCollections) {
					if (fc.name == currentLayerName) {
						footstepManager.SetFootstepCollection(fc);
					}
				}
			}
			Debug.Log("Found Terrain");
		}

	}
}
```


(##) Animation Rigging

The player character must be able to freely swap to and use different object and weapons.
In this game, santa is able to be unarmed, holding a present, and holding a candy cane gun.
While possible to manually create animations for these instances, it is much more scalable to introduce dynamic animations through animation rigging.

Unity has an animation rigging package that allows the independent adjustment of bones in a mesh skeleton.
This system has a mild implementation in the base project which was tweaked to work with Santa's large blocky hands and the objects in this game.

The rigging system includes the adjustment of 2 sets of bones: The left arm and right arm. With the left, typically corresponding to the front part of a weapon -- as typically found in 
right-handed weapon wielding. The rigging system introduced Inverse Kinematics to ensure that the entire arms, from the wrist to the shoulder joint, is appropriately positioned and rotated 
to be physically plausible.

The rigging system can also be seen in the head and body. When looking upwards or downwards, the character can be seen directly looking in the appropriate direction.
For this to be possibly implemented on all animations, it is required to be dynamically rigged. 

The combination of both the hand and body rigging results in a more controlled experience for the player. The player feels more in control of their own character and has a stronger
sense of immersion.

(##) Achievements

Not all systems in this game is based upon the base project's skeleton. A notable one is the achievement system, which supplies the player with additional objectives to complete.
The game supports 4 achievements, each with a task that often requires the player to do more than requried in a typical run.
When achieved or failed, a brief toast message will appear to communicate to the player the achievement's state. 

While not particularly a technical challenge, small features help to make the game feel more developed.
