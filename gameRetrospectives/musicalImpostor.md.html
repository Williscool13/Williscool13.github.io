Musical Impostor is a brief game made for the 20 Second Game Jam 2023. As the game jam's name implies, the game's core loop must last precisely 20 seconds.
This limitation helps keep the development time of the game low, and poses challenges for us to consider when making the game.


This game was created as part of a team consisting of a composer, 3d artist, level designer, and myself. 
The level designer is the very same one from my first game [The Lost Melody](theLostMelody.md.html)

# The 3 Cs
## Character
In this game, the player plays as a melon detective investigating an orchestra. There was a police tip that a notorious serial killer was on the loose and they were hiding amongst the orchestra.
The player's job is to find the impostor, who exposes themselves through sound. The impostor is unable to play musical instruments, so the sound they make will be inconsistent with the instrument they're holding.
The game has 3 outcomes: The impostor is found, and they are blended into a fine pulp; 
The wrong member is accused, blending the innocent member into a fine pulp; 
Or no accusation is made fast enough, and the detective are blended into a fine pulp.

## Controls
The game is in 3d game, and is controlled like a typical 3d first person shooter. 
The player's primary control scheme is WASD to move and Left Click to accuse a target.
Notably, to better single out independent orchestra member's sounds, the player is equipped with a flashlight which isolates the targetted fruit's sound, focusing their hearing.
With these tools, the game's loop is fairly straightforward, requiring very little onboarding.


## Camera
The camera is mostly a first person view from the perspective of the detective, but before the game starts the detective is available for inspection through an orbital camera.
Post-game, there is also a brief scene with a dolly-attached camera for a brief post-mortem on the success of the player's accusation.

# The Game
Due to the brevity of this game, the game doesn't have a significant amount of features to discuss. That said, this project is where I first used the 3d tools provided by Unity such as:

 - Cinemachine
 - Timeline
 - Baked Lighting
 - Fullscreen Shaders
 - Working in 3d Space
 - Probuilder

(##) Level Design

The game is set on a stage, where the orchestra members are preparing for the show. 
The premise is that the game is only 20 seconds because the orchestra is set to play in 20 seconds.

The stage is small and not much is exposed to the player. 
The scene is fairly dark and the light would not be activated until the orchestra would begin playing.
This meant that there wasn't very much level to design.
