The Lost Melody would be my first published game, produced for a small game jam called the Tavern Game Jam Autumn 2023. 
In this game jam, I had worked with a small team of 5 members, where I was both the group lead and sole programmer. 
The team consisted of 2 artists, both specializing in 2d pixel art; 1 composer, formally trained in classical composition; and 1 level designer. 
I was personally friends with the level designer and we both worked together to create the 5 levels present in the game (it's really 6, but one of the levels was a gimmick).

# The 3 Cs

## Controls
As is tradition for first games, this game was a 2d pixel-art platformer. 
But 2d platformers have the potential to be fairly complicated, especially with regards to the character controller. 
An unresponsive and sluggish character controller can frequently turn players away before they have even given the level design a chance.

I had decided to model the controller to common platformer mechanics. Including double jump, dash, and wall clutch. 
A particularly notable influence was [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/). 
I had recently finished playing through Hollow Knight. The game had enchanted me by its responsive intuitive controls.

Getting the character controller to be in a comfortable state is a trial that took longer than optimal. 
And did not complete out in a state that was satisfactory. 
But given the time constraint, was not modified further to move on to level creation.


## Character
The game was conceptualized with a story to immerse the player into being their character.
The character is a musical spirit who has lost their voice, causing the creatures in the realm to be restless and lost.

This lost voice is emphasized in the gameplay through the character's ability progression.
The player begins the game with no abilities - only the standard walk and jump, gaining a new ability after rescuing another creature.
Additionally, as the player gained more abilities and restored more balance, more tracks of music would be enabled. 
The soundtrack would become richer and fuller after every level. 

The game would finish with the player ascending both literally and metaphorically, 
regaining their lost music, returning peace and joy to the creatures in this realm, continuing on their journey to return music to all realms.

## Camera
Unfortunately, due to time constraints and limited experience at the time working with cameras, the camera was simply set to a basic hard-follow of the character sprite.
No limitations were placed to prevent it from peeking behind inaccessible areas, but that was subsequently managed through level design and careful "death-zone" placements.

Not to promote poor code, but this was the extent of our camera system. I had only discovered the magic of cinemachine in future projects. 
```
 Vector3 targetPos = player.position;
 targetPos.z = -10;
 // a hard coded offset
 targetPos.y += 1.3f;
 targetPos.x += 2.2f;
 transform.position = targetPos;
 
 int mementoIndex = 0;
 foreach (bool b in GameDataManager.Instance.PlayerAbilityData.abilities) {
	 if (b) {
		 mementoIndex += 1;
	 }
 }
 // god mode significantly increases jump height
 if (mementoIndex > 4) {
	 cam.orthographicSize = 9.5f;
 }
```

More criticisms of the code can be found in Section [Programming].

# Level design
The game is divided into 6 levels: 
 - Forest (Me)
 - Mountain1 (Me)
 - Attic (Both)
 - Mountain 2 (Me)
 - Lake (Me)
 - Clouds (Both)

The abilities the player received are obtained in this order:
	
	<div style="text-align:center;">**Wall-Clutch -> Dash -> Double Jump -> Water Walking -> God Mode**</div>

(##) _Progression_

Each level was designed to be as non-repetitive as possible. Allowing the player to experience all the abilities have to offer.
Additionally, the levels are designed to have progression. 
Earlier parts function as simple demonstrations of what their new abilities do; later parts are full demonstrations of the potential tricks they enable.

For example, wall-clutching allows the player to cross large gaps, as when the player jumps off a wall, their jump distance is significantly higher than usual. 
Wall Clutching resets the number of times the player can jump/dash, which they can use to cross extreme gaps found in the later parts of the double jump level.
While not always followed to the letter, development would try to follow the 3-step rule.

	<div style="text-align:center;">**Introduction -> Mastery -> Surprise**</div>

Creating the levels took a significant amount of time, with each level iterated several times. 
Development is over 6 months ago, and access is no longer available to the scratch notes used to ideate the levels.
Throughout development, many draft sub-sections were unused due to their repetitiveness.
The game's playtime was not designed to be long, and the game was kept short to maintain full player attention.

(##) _Developer Blinders_

The hardest level in the game is Attic. It features a significant number of hazards: **Spikes**.
These spikes would instantly kill the player, though that blow would be softened by the numerous checkpoints dotted around the maps.

!!!
   I confess that this was my fault. It brings me some amount joy watching players suffer through my levels because of the pinpoint accuracy required to complete them.

The difficulty delta between the developer experience and the player experience would be a recurring phenomenon in many of my games. And even in many other games online.
Due to the frequent playtesting of their own games, developers can complete challenging tasks trivially due to extreme repetition. 
This results in a poor understanding of the true difficulty of their game.

![**Spikes!**](tlm/spikestlm.png)

(##) _Linearity_

The game is fairly linear, with all of the stages having a straight path to victory. 
This made it easier to both create the levels and guide the player strategically. 
This is displayed in the player's path to the levels, particularly the transition zones. 

The player frequently passes by "teleport gates" which cannot be reached until the player has obtained the appropriate ability.
This means that when the player unlocks a new ability, they will have an idea of where they can take advantage of their new ability.
As a result, it is fairly difficult for the player to lose their way.

(##) Platform mechanics

Some mechanics were thoroughly implemented but were not used as often as deserved.
For instance, extremely fast-moving platforms which could retain the player.
And another that was a particular technical challenge: 
	The ability to clutch onto a wall that is moving and stay on it cleanly. There were edge cases where this would fail, but it was largely successful.
Both of these techniques were implemented sparsely.

But they were available for use and allowed development of creative scenarios for the player to explore.
Of course, the rule of progressive difficulty was always followed, only introducing complex mechanics in mid to later stages of the levels.



# Programming
Games always appear less complex upon glancing than under the hood. There are several features that may be taken for granted but had to be considered to make the game enjoyable.
Minor but important features such as checkpoints, a dialogue system to communicate with the player, smooth transitions, and audio consistency. 

(##) It was all a mess

I was the only developer in the group. Which means the task of coding, implementing, and adjusting were all left to me. The other members could playtest and feedback, 
but the task of iterating ultimately rested upon my shoulders. With the exception of level design, where I had help from my friend. 

Given how much had to be executed against the short development time available, the code fell apart and became extremely coupled very quickly. 

 - Encapsulation was ignored in favor of rapid iteration.
 - Singletons were used liberally, creating dependency issues everywhere. 
 - Any changes in one part of the code had potential to break other unrelated code.
 - Code was repeated multiple times

The deterioration of code quality rose sharply near the end of the project. 
The final build of our project was only uploaded an hour or so before the deadline.
Timing was tight, but the group put forward a finished product that the team was proud to produce.

(##) Singletons

At this point in my developer journey, Singleton use was rampant, existing in places where they were not necessary. 
```
// Game Data
public static GameDataManager Instance { get; private set; }
// Player Character
public static PlayerPlatformSystem Instance;
// Music System
public static AudioSystem Instance { get; private set; }
```

The player character was greatly coupled with the scenes. It was not possible to run scenes without a player character present. 
Audio systems would need to exist in every scene to prevent null reference errors from scene managers.

These systems were not required to be Singletons and required better decoupling from the other game systems.
For example, Game Data would be better implemented as a collection of scriptable objects, allowing any class to access it as necessary and exposing the field for viewing at any time.
This style of architecture is outlined in a talk in [Unite 2017 by Schell Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk). 



# Limitations
(##) Scope Creep

Unsurprisingly, as a first game jam game, the scope that the group had set for the project was too large. 
There was no feasible way the game could be completed in this overscoped state within the time limit of 1 week.
What was once a lush graveyard turned into a precariously hanging platform. 
The grand idea of an underwater level was reduced to a joke walking-on-water level. 

(##) Unanticipated Delays

In what was a devastating scenario, both our artists were heavily occupied throughout the week. Forcing us to use some placeholder assets in the final build of the game.
It is not anyone's fault, life happens and a game jam is not that important. But it meant that the group was crunched significantly for time near the end. Hence, the deterioration of good code practices.
Some animations needed reworking, tilemaps needed to be configured and set up to look consistent. The final few days were exhausting to say the least.

Something I didn't know at the time was that 2d games require a significant amount of work from the artists. Almost everything in the game needs to be meticulously hand animated. 
This left other team members with very little to do while waiting. 

(##) Inconsistencies

The time crunch also made several components of the game inconsistent. 
The art style of our artists were not particularly consistent, leading to jarring shifts in art style, pixel density, and color palettes in multiple sprites.

Inconsistencies are not limited to art style. Some levels were significantly harder than others, requiring a different skillset than envisioned for the game.
The game was not set out to be a precision platformer, but some levels required accurate movements and controls from the player. 
Given more time to iterate on the game, several entire levels may have potentially been scrapped to make for a more cohesive experience.

# Strengths
(##) Music

The composer for this project was extraordinary. She knew exactly what had to be done, knew the technicalities of production, and was very open to ideas from the whole group.
She was pursuing a master degree in music in the UK; I wonder if that's all been done by now.

(##) Level design

I think the levels that were designed were well done. It is hard to be innovative in the fairly saturated space of 2d platformers, 
but our best was put forward; the levels were interesting; the players were challenged; and we had fun!
