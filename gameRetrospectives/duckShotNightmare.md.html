Duck Shot Nightmare's development was pretty much a Nightmare. This game was developed independently by me, leveraging art and music from the gracious [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/)
The premise of the game is fairly simple, the player plays as a stranger who found a random carnival game in the middle of the desert. The game's inhabitants (the ducks) are sentient.
The player shoots the ducks, as they are told to do, listening to the anguished cries of the ducks. Eventually culminating in a final boss-fight with the duck god.

# The 3 Cs
For the most part, the game lacks 2 of the 3 Cs: The camera is entirely static with the exception of the intro sequence, and there is no player character. The controls are also fairly straightforward.
Shoot with left click and reload with r. This game was very simple and existed to showcase one cute game idea that I had.

# The Game Idea
<div style="text-align:center;">**The player can shoot dialogue bubbles. **</div>

![Ducks are aware of the dialogue bubbles](dsn/speechdsn.png)

Yes. That is the whole pitch. Even though I finished this game, it did not at all come out as a product that I was happy with. The dialogue bubbles were valid targets and 
properly aligned to the screen with appropriate padding around the screen edges. 
But there were simply too few ways the player could interact with the game. The game lacked a dynamic angle that made it interesting.

I was happy with how the dialogue system turned out, though it all was set up too manually. I felt I was hard-coding far too many interactions that made the game a chore to work through.
The dialogue gave me a way to approach this game as a story based one rather than a gameplay focused one. The ducks feel pain and are suffering. But the player continues to shoot them to rack up
points. A mild showcase at the needless violence we inflict unknowingly to enteratin ourselves.

As the game progressed, The game would distort, almost as though a corruption was taking over. Ducks would die in increasingly violent ways. Dialogue would be foreboding and threatening at times. This added a certain ambience that I enjoyed, and conveyed the mysterious tone I wished to impart, well.

(##) Final Boss

I had always planned on adding a final boss. This boss would have a fair amount of health that would span the entire screen. It was fun coming up with mechanics on how to beat them.
For example, shooting the ducks surrounding the final boss would expose weak-points on the boss that can be shot to deal significantly more damage, as compared to shooting the boss directly.

If the final boss was not defeated sufficiently fast enough, the ducks would overpower the player and the player would meet their demise. \
It was great, but was at the end of the game. An end that I felt not many would have had the patience to reach.

# Limitations
(##) One Trick Pony

Even with the angle of a story behind it, the game still felt lacking. 
Perhaps it has merit, but repeated testing on this game has left me as a developer with the feeling that the game is just not unique enough.
The game also felt slightly too long, perhaps a shortened more condense game session would have made it more enjoyable.

(##) Weak Style

The game doesn't look very good. It lacks special effects, colorful variations, and has very few moving parts. The static-ness of the whole system makes the game feel slow and people without the patience to sit through
the game until the end would not have the opportunity to see the final boss.

(##) Lessons Learned

Coming out of this project left me with the confidence that using libraries is not a cruch, but a necessity. To make good products in a reasonable amount of time, leveraging the work
that others have produced before me is required. Pride should not prevent the creation of good products.
