				**[About Me](index.html)**

	My name is William Gunawan. I am an Indonesian programmer specialized in graphics programming. I use this page to write about my activities in graphics programming and my thoughts regarding certain graphics topics.
	
	I make small games when I'm not working on graphics programming, which you can play on [my itch page](https://williscool13.itch.io/). Some of them aren't very good.
	
	I usually leave my projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Williscool13), if you have any interest in seeing my code. 
	
	My big project right now is my game engine, [Will Engine](https://github.com/Williscool13/WillEngineV2).
	
	I'm always open to meeting new people. If you need help with anything Graphics/Game related or just want to chat, feel free to contact me at twtw40@gmail.com or my discord (williscool).
	
	I will now leave you with pictures of my dog, Barry.
