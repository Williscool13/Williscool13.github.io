				**[About Me](https://williscool13.github.io/)**

	My name is William Gunawan. I am an Indonesian programmer specialized in graphics programming. I use this page to write about my activities in graphics programming and my thoughts regarding certain graphics topics.
	
	I make small games when I'm not working on graphics programming, which you can play on [my itch page](https://williscool13.itch.io/). Some of them aren't very good.
	
	I usually leave my projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Williscool13), if you have any interest in seeing my code.
	
	At times I feel like unmolded clay. If you have any interest in mentoring me, please feel free to contact me at twtw40@gmail.com or my discord (williscool).
	
	
	I will now leave you with pictures of my dog. His name is Berry.
